Now testing this poly1305 implementation.
Expected runtime to completion on a modern desktop running CPython is around
10 days +/-. If this passes any checkpoint (10010, 123456, etc., lines), then
it is likely not suffering from any debilitating implementation flaw (at least
in terms of correctness, no guarantees regarding sideband attacks), and you
can probably kill it.
